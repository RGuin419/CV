    <h2>Summary.</h2>
    <p class="introduction"><i>I have been working at IBM as a DataStage developer and Production support member for more than 6 years. When a new project arises, I, as a developer, design code DataStage. Change the code in DataStage to fix bugs, redesigning the code in DataStage as per requirements. In addition, I ensure data delivery by a specific deadline, address incidents before SLA, and address customer concerns about data quality as a member of production support. 
I write shell scripts to meet various needs and automate processes. I have high experience in troubleshooting. In addition to DataStage Director and Designer, I have extensive experience with SQW, InfoSphere Change Data Capture, PL/SQL Developer, BMC Remedy, Unica, Unix, and AWK commands.
I am very interested in the Cloud and have already earned several Azure certifications for it, including DP-203. I would like to work in a cloud environment in the future, assuming the right opportunity arises.</i></p>
